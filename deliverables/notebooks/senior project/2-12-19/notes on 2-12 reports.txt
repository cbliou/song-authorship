- During validation, make sure you only classify each example as one label
 - baseline idea: identify any one of the genre's = correct
 - complex idea: take a distance between labels and predicted accuracy vector
- moreover, find out which features discriminate the songs well
    - find some metric to talk about which words are better 
- for four categories (genre)
 - break down each % of category
- talk about random assignment - no information rate



if i use python:
1. can't proofread as well
2. visualzations r key in $R$

big key ideas still need to address:
- overlap
- model interpretation (how are the songs being discriminated???)
	- ideas:
		- for nb look at coefficients
		- for RF look at first couple of nodes
		- for my own methods take distance in distributions and find maximally different words


- confirm that if i am selected to represent cal poly, can i resubmit a paper?

what we have done

- genre as a predictor - predict weekly ranks, peak position
- genre as a response - logistic regression on pop and rap
- unsupervised clustering - lda
- supervised clustering - current nb (classification methods)

- for gini index : only use pop and rap not the genre combinations
- also, remove words based on # of times it appears otherwise we are overfitting on one word example.
